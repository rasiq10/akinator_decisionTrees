Python project implenting a smaller version of the game akinator using Artificial Intelligence algorithms.

You can play the original game here - https://en.akinator.com

To run the code execute the akinator.py file and provide input as 'y' or 'n'.

I have used a small dataset and read it statically.
You can choose to have an external database.

You do not have to update the code if you increase or decrease the database rows/columns.

To implement I have used 3 major concepts:
  - Decision Trees using CART
  - Information Gain
  - Gini Impurity
 
You can also choose to include fuzzy logic to handle non-crisp inputs like probably, probably not etc.

The program builds the tree first then asks the user for input and prints the tree simultaneously.

If you plan to expand the database make sure you make the entry unique.
